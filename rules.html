							<p>1. The parties to the agreement.</p>
							<p>The contract is concluded between the Internet service for the exchange of title signs,
								hereinafter the Contractor, on the one hand, and the Customer, represented by the one who used
								the services of the Contractor, on the other hand.</p>
							<p>2. List of terms.</p>
							<p>2.1. Exchange of title signs is an automated Internet service product, which is provided by the
								Contractor on the basis of these rules.<br>
								2.2. The Customer is an individual who agrees to the terms of the Contractor and this agreement,
								to which he joins.<br>
								2.3. The title sign is a conventional unit of a particular payment systеm, which corresponds to
								the calculations of electronic systems and indicates the scope of rights corresponding to the
								contract of the electronic payment systеm and its Customer.<br>
								2.4. Application — information transmitted by the Customer for the use of the Contractor’s funds
								in electronic form and indicating that he accepts the terms of use of the service, which are
								offered by the Contractor in this application.</p>
							<p>3. Terms of the agreement.</p>
							<p>These rules are considered to be organized due to the terms of the public offer, which is formed
								during the submission of the application by the Customer and is one of the main components of
								this agreement. The public offer is the information displayed by the contractor about the
								conditions for submitting the application. The main component of the public offer is the actions
								taken at the end of the application by the Customer and indicating his exact intentions to make
								a deal on the terms proposed by the Contractor before the completion of this application. The
								time, date, and parameters of the application are created by the Contractor automatically at the
								end of the formation of this application. The offer must be accepted by the Customer within 24
								hours from the end of the formation of the application. The service contract comes into force
								from the moment of receipt of the title signs in the full amount specified in the application
								from the Customer to the details of the Contractor. Transactions with title signs are taken into
								account according to the rules, regulations and format of electronic systems for calculations.
								The contract is valid for a period that is established from the moment of filing the application
								until termination on the initiative of one of the parties.</p>
							<p>4. Subject of the agreement.</p>
							<p>By using technical methods, the Contractor undertakes to exchange title signs for a commission
								fee from the Customer, after the application is submitted by this person and does this by
								selling title signs to persons wishing to purchase them at an amount specified no lower than in
								the application submitted by the Customer. The Contractor undertakes to transfer the funds to
								the details specified by the Customer. In case of profit arising during the exchange, it remains
								on the Contractor’s account as an additional benefit and a premium for commission services.</p>
							<p>5. In addition.</p>
							<p>5.1. If the Contractor receives an amount that differs from the amount specified in the
								application, the Contractor makes a recalculation that corresponds to the actual receipt of
								title signs. If this amount exceeds the amount specified in the application by more than 10%,
								the Contractor terminates the contract unilaterally and all funds are returned to the Customer’s
								details, taking into account the deducted amount for commission expenses during the
								transfer.<br>
								5.2. If the title signs are not sent by the Contractor to the Customer’s specified details
								within 24 hours, the Customer has the full right to demand termination of the agreement and
								cancel his application, thereby returning the title signs to his account in full. The
								application for termination of the agreement and return of the title signs is executed by the
								Contractor in the event that the funds have not yet been transferred to the specified details of
								the Customer. In case of cancellation of the contract, the return of the electronic currency is
								made within 24 hours from the date of receipt of the request for termination of the contract. If
								delays in the return occurred through no fault of the Contractor, he is not responsible for
								them.<br>
								5.3. If the title signs are not received from the Customer to the Contractor’s account within
								the specified period, from the moment the Customer submits the application, the agreement
								between the parties is terminated by the Contractor on the one hand, since the contract does not
								enter into force. The customer may not be notified about this. If the title signs arrive at the
								Contractor’s details after the specified period, then such funds are transferred back to the
								Customer’s account, and all commission costs associated with the transfer are deducted from
								these funds.<br>
								5.4. If there is a delay in transferring funds to the details specified by the Customer, due to
								the fault of the settlement systеm, the Contractor is not responsible for damage resulting from
								a long receipt of funds. In this case, the Customer must agree that all claims will be made to
								the settlement systеm, and the Contractor provides assistance to the extent possible within the
								framework of the law.<br>
								5.5. In case of detection of forgery of communication flows or exerting influence in order to
								worsen the work of the Contractor, namely its program code, the application is suspended, and
								the transferred funds are recalculated in accordance with the current agreement. If the Customer
								does not agree with the recalculation, he has every right to terminate the contract and the
								title signs will be sent to the details specified by the Customer.<br>
								5.6. In case of using the Contractor’s services, the Customer fully agrees that the Contractor
								bears limited liability corresponding to the scope of these rules of the received title signs
								and does not give additional guarantees to the Customer, and also does not bear additional
								responsibility to him. Accordingly, the Customer does not bear additional responsibility to the
								Contractor.<br>
								5.7. The Customer undertakes to comply with the norms corresponding to the legislation, as well
								as not to forge communication flows and not to create obstacles to the normal operation of the
								Contractor’s program code.<br>
								5.8. The Contractor is not responsible for the damage and consequences of an erroneous transfer
								of electronic currency in the event that the Customer specified incorrect details when
								submitting the application.</p>
							<p>6. Warranty period</p>
							<p>Within 24 hours from the moment of execution of the exchange of title signs, the Contractor
								gives a guarantee for the services provided, unless other terms are agreed.</p>
							<p>7. Unforeseen circumstances.</p>
							<p>In the event that unforeseen circumstances arise during the processing of the Customer’s
								application that contribute to the Contractor’s failure to fulfill the terms of the contract,
								the deadlines for the execution of the application are postponed to the appropriate duration of
								force majeure. The Contractor is not responsible for overdue obligations.</p>
							<p>8. The form of the agreement.</p>
							<p>This agreement is accepted by both parties, represented by the Contractor and the Customer, as
								an agreement of equal legal force, indicated in writing.</p>
							<p>9. Working with maps of England, Germany and the USA.</p>
							<p>For cardholders of the countries of England, Germany and the USA, the conditions for the
								transfer of title characters are extended indefinitely, corresponding to a full verification of
								the cardholder’s data. The funds are not subject to any transactions during the entire period
								and are in full amount on the Contractor’s account.</p>
							<p>10 Claims and disputes.</p>
							<p>Claims under this agreement are accepted by the Contractor in the form of an e-mail in which the
								Customer indicates the essence of the claim. This letter is sent to the details of the
								Contractor specified on the website.</p>
							<p>11. Conducting exchange operations.</p>
							<p>11.1. It is strictly prohibited to use the services of the Contractor for illegal transfers and
								fraudulent activities. At the conclusion of this agreement, the Customer undertakes to comply
								with these requirements and, in case of fraud, to bear criminal liability established by the
								legislation at the moment.<br>
								11.2. If it is impossible to fulfill the request automatically, due to circumstances beyond the
								control of the Contractor, such as lack of communication, lack of funds, or erroneous Customer
								data, the funds are credited to the account within the next 24 hours or returned to the
								Customer’s details minus commission costs.<br>
								11.3.At the first request, the Contractor has the right to transmit information about the
								transfer of electronic currency to law enforcement agencies, the administration of settlement
								systems, as well as to victims of illegal actions, victims of fraud proven by judicial
								authorities.<br>
								11.4. The Customer undertakes to submit all documents proving his identity in case of suspicion
								of fraud and money laundering.<br>
								11.5. The Customer undertakes not to interfere with the Contractor’s work and not to cause
								damage to its software and hardware, and the Customer also undertakes to transmit accurate
								information to ensure that the Contractor fulfills all the terms of the contract.</p>
							<p>12. Waiver of obligations.</p>
